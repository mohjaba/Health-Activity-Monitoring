class Validator:

  '''
  This class is responsible to receive the raw data, find which tweets are actually valid or trusted 
  information based on the criteria the system has and then save them inside the MongoDB.
    
    ** Attributes **
    client : This is the actual connection with the MongoDB
    RawTweets : This is a list that has all the tweets that were grabbed
                more resently from Twitter
    loc_tweets : A list of the Geo Located tweets after the locator method is executed
    good_tweets : A list of the tweets that the first filter let to pass
    final_tweets : A list of the tweets that the filter filter let to pass
    keywords2 : A list with the words used as the filtering terms for the first filter.
                It is read from keywords2.txt file
    keywords3 : A list with the words used as the filtering terms for the first filter.
                It is read from keywords3.txt file

    ** Methods **
    __init__ : The constructor of the class must be present for
               python classes.

    locator : This method checks all tweets and returns only those that are geotagged or uses 
              the location of the user to decide the coordinates of a tweet.
    
    data_filter2 : This method searches through all the Tweets for each word in the keyword
                   list. If a keyword exists in the tweet's text and the tweet has not been
                   added to the final list by a previous keyword success it is added to the
                   tweets that will be returned.

    data_filter3 : This function searches through all the Tweets for each word in the keyword
                   list. If a keyword exists in the tweet's text and the tweet has not been
                   discarded from the final list by a previous keyword success it is discarded
                   from the tweets that will be returned.
